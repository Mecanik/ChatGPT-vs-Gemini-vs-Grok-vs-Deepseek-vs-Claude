Hi [First Name],

I’m thrilled to introduce [Your Floral Shop Name], a brand-new boutique florist dedicated to filling your everyday moments—and life’s biggest celebrations—with unforgettable flowers.

Why We’re Different

Fresh-Cut Beauty, Hand-Crafted Daily
Each morning we source premium blooms from trusted growers, then design distinctive bouquets and arrangements that stay vibrant longer and smell heavenly.

Tailored to You
From modern minimalism to lush, garden-style compositions, our florists craft custom pieces that echo your personal taste or event theme—no two arrangements are ever the same.

Flexible Flower Subscriptions
Choose our weekly or monthly delivery plans and have fresh flowers appear at your doorstep or office on your schedule. Pause or swap styles anytime.

Events & Weddings
Whether you’re envisioning an intimate dinner party or a grand “I do,” we handle everything from concept to clean-up—arches, centerpieces, bridal party florals, and on-site styling.

Grand-Opening Offer

As a welcome, enjoy 15% off your first order or subscription (code: BLOOM15) when you book by August 31, 2025.
