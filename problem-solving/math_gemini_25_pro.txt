The sum of the two integrals, A + B, is approximately 5.657.

Here's a breakdown of the calculation:

Integral A
The first integral is:

A=∫ 
0
1
​
 e 
x 
2
 
 dx

This integral, which is a form of the Gaussian integral, doesn't have a solution that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, its value is found using numerical methods. The approximate value of A is 1.463.

Integral B
The second integral is:

B=∫ 
1
e 
2
 
​
 ln( 
x

​
 )dx

This integral can be solved analytically. By simplifying the integrand and using integration by parts, we find that:

B= 
2
e 
2
 +1
​
 

The approximate value of B is 4.194.

The Sum: A + B
Adding the values of the two integrals gives us the final result:

A+B≈1.463+4.194=5.657

The more precise value, obtained from numerical calculation, is approximately 5.657179795372472.
