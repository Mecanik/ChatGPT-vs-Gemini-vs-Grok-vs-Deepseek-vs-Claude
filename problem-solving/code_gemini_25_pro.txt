Summary of Fixes
The primary issue in your original code was undefined behavior due to attempting to copy a string into an unallocated pointer. The copy_string function was modified to dynamically allocate memory for the destination string using malloc, ensuring there's a valid memory location to copy the source string into.

Additionally, a crucial fix was implemented to prevent memory leaks. The dynamically allocated memory for copy in main is now freed using free(copy) once it's no longer needed. This is essential for good memory management in C.
