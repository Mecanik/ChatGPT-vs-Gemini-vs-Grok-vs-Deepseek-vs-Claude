Problem Statement:

Given:

A = Integral from 0 to 1 of e^(x^2) dx

B = Integral from 1 to e^2 of ln(sqrt(x)) dx

Find A + B.

Solution:

Part A: Evaluating Integral e^(x^2) from 0 to 1

This integral doesn't have an elementary antiderivative. We can express it using:

Series expansion: e^(x^2) = sum from n=0 to ∞ of (x^(2n)/n!)
Integrating term by term gives: A = sum from n=0 to ∞ of 1/(n!(2n+1)) ≈ 1.46265

Using the imaginary error function:
A = (√π/2) erfi(1) ≈ 1.46265

Part B: Evaluating Integral ln(√x) from 1 to e^2

First simplify:
ln(√x) = (1/2)ln x

So B = (1/2) × integral of ln x from 1 to e^2

Using integration by parts:
∫ ln x dx = x ln x - x + C

Evaluating from 1 to e^2:
= [e^2 ln(e^2) - e^2] - [1 ln 1 - 1] = (2e^2 - e^2) - (-1) = e^2 + 1

Thus:
B = (e^2 + 1)/2 ≈ 4.19453

Combining A and B:

Exact form:
A + B = (√π erfi(1) + e^2 + 1)/2

Numerical verification:
A ≈ 1.46265
B ≈ 4.19453
A + B ≈ 5.65718

Using exact form:
(2.9253 + 7.38906 + 1)/2 ≈ 5.65718 (matches)

Final Answer:
(√π erfi(1) + e^2 + 1)/2
