# Solution to A + B Integral Problem

## Given Integrals

A = ∫₀¹ e^(x²) dx

B = ∫₁^(e²) ln(√x) dx

Find A + B

## Solution for Integral A

A = ∫₀¹ e^(x²) dx

This integral doesn't have a closed form in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed using the error function. The integral ∫₀ˣ e^(t²) dt is related to the imaginary error function.

Using the substitution and properties of the error function:
∫₀¹ e^(x²) dx = (√π/2) · erfi(1)

where erfi is the imaginary error function. Numerically, this evaluates to approximately 1.4627.

## Solution for Integral B

B = ∫₁^(e²) ln(√x) dx

First, simplify the integrand:
ln(√x) = ln(x^(1/2)) = (1/2)ln(x)

So: B = ∫₁^(e²) (1/2)ln(x) dx = (1/2)∫₁^(e²) ln(x) dx

To evaluate ∫ln(x) dx, use integration by parts:
- Let u = ln(x), dv = dx
- Then du = (1/x)dx, v = x

∫ln(x) dx = x ln(x) - ∫x · (1/x) dx = x ln(x) - x + C

Therefore:
∫₁^(e²) ln(x) dx = [x ln(x) - x]₁^(e²)
= (e² ln(e²) - e²) - (1 ln(1) - 1)
= (e² · 2 - e²) - (0 - 1)
= 2e² - e² + 1
= e² + 1

So: B = (1/2)(e² + 1) = (e² + 1)/2

## Final Answer

**Exact Answer:**
A + B = (√π/2) · erfi(1) + (e² + 1)/2

**Numerical Answer:**
- A ≈ 1.4627
- e² ≈ 7.389, so B = (7.389 + 1)/2 ≈ 4.1945

Therefore: A + B ≈ 1.4627 + 4.1945 ≈ 5.66
